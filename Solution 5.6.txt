This sentence cannot be valid in any way : R infact is not included in the AND statement, so we can tell
that R can be or cannot be true in certain circumstances.

P	Q	R
T	T	T
T	T	F
T	F	T
T	F	F
F	T	T
F	T	F
F	F	T
F	F	F

So, we can build the new truth table as this:

~(P && Q) 	~P	R 
F		F	T
F		F	F	
F		F	T
F		F	F
F		T	T
F		T	F
T		T	T
T		T	F
