We know that a is or a Cube or a Tetra or is Large.
We also know that a is not a cube or a equals to b or a is large
Furthemore a cannot be large or a = c.
Finally is not true that c equals to itself and a is a Tetra.


For the 1st, 2nd and 3rd sentences if a is Large to get a true sentence we must consider that
1) a must be or a Cube or a Tetra
2) a equals to b or is not a Cube
3) a = c
We can tell that a equals to c if a is Large

For the 1st, 2nd and 3rd sentences if a is Cube to get a true sentence we must consider that
1) a must be or a Large or a Tetra
2) a equals to b or is Large
3) a must not be Large or a = c

And if we say also that a is also not Large, to get a true sentence we must consider that:
2) a equals to b
3) a = c

We can tell that a equals to b if a is not a Large Cube
