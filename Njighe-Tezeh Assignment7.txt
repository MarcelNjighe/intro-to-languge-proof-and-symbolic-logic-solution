5.1
It is valid, because we know that P is not true, so the only way that P || Q is true is that Q is also true

P || Q	~P	Q
T	F	T	
T	F	F	
F	T	T
F	T	F
 
5.2
It is not valid, because we got P || Q and Q true, but to transform P || Q into a true sentence we have 
to got P or Q true. So, P can also be true. Furthemore, we know that from P infer P || Q, so it can be 
possible that P is true and not only false

P || Q	Q	~P		P
T	T	F		T
T	F	F		T
T	T	T		F
F	F	T 	        F

5.3
~(P || Q)	~P
F		F	
F		F
F		T
T		T

5.5
~(P && Q) 	~P
F		F	
T		F
T		T
T		T

5.7
We know that Max or Claire is at Home,
we know also that Max is not happy or Carl is at home.
Furthemore Claire is not happy or Carl is Happy.
We can tell that Carl is Happy

5.15
We know that b is a tetraedron and c is a cube.
We also know that either c is larger than b or else they are identical.
Knowing that, we can immediatly say that b and c cannot be identical, because they are different objects.
So the only way that the 2nd sentence can be true is that c is larger than b,
so b is smaller than c.

5.16
So we accept that Max or Claire is at home, 
we suppose that Max is at home. we know that Carl is happy.
It is true that either Scruffy or Carl is unhappy.
We conclude that in this case Scruffyis unhappy.
