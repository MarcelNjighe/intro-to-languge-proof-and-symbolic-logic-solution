Language, Proof, and Logic is a textbook and software package, intended for use in undergraduate level logic courses. The text covers topics such as the boolean connectives, formal proof techniques, quantifiers, basic set theory, and induction. The last few chapters include material on soundness, completeness, and Godel's incompleteness theorems. The book is appropriate for a wide range of courses, from first logic courses for undergraduates (philosophy, mathematics, and computer science) to a first graduate logic course.
